## Deliverable 2

1. A summary of your decisions and the options you considered for your component(s) (UI/frontend, logic/backend, database) so your TA knows what you have built and why. (Soft limit of 600 words. This doesnâ€™t mean you have to write 600 words. Quality is more important than quantity).

2. Individual contributions explaining who did what. You can keep it to at most one paragraph per person to highlight any work that is not captured in any of the repos.

3. All the details and instructions needed for your TA to see and verify your work. You need to provide enough documentation so your TA can confirm:

a. Your software does what you say it does.

b. You've done the work (i.e., it's something on your repo/servers, etc.).

4. Your application (see deployment section below for details)
